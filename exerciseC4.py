# Exercise 2 (easy)
# # A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age .
# # If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12,
# # the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15 .
# #
# # Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of
# # their movie ticket .
